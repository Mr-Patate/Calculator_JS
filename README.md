# Calculator_JS
HTML/CSS/JS Calculator

This is a simple + - * / Calculator.

*******

The reason of this Calculator is simple: I have a mac. And mac does not have this cool and easy Numeric-Pad at the right side of the keyboard.
I have a French keyboard and on a French keyboard I have to maintain the SHIFT button to write a number. This is so painful. My calculator helps a lot.

This could be optimized by showing some last result in a little memory box. Maybe also pick some calcul from the memory box and edit them.
